1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:18,156
We humans are becoming an urban species,

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,956
so cities, they are our natural habitat.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,180
That is where we live.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,796
In 2014, over 54 percent

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,436
of the world population

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,500
was living in cities,

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,076
and I can bet you

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,756
that so many of these people have thought

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,356
of how they would do things differently,

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,036
like if I only had the tools

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,436
to change things in my city,

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,716
what would I do?

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,340
What would my dream city be like?

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,716
And these tools,

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,100
this is just what we gave them.

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,476
Two years ago, my team and I,

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,916
we released a game,

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,636
"Cities: Skylines."

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,500
It is a game about building cities.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,156
So I have always been interested in cities as systems.

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,076
It's something that I find immensely interesting.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,236
But what I didn't understand

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,740
was that I am not alone in this.

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,156
People love cities.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,060
They are interested. They have ideas.

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,916
The game was an instant hit.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,540
So far, over three and a half million people have played it.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,876
And it's not just about playing.

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,636
We also have really awesome sharing systems.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,356
So people play, they create cities

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,196
and then they are sharing these creations,

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,260
showing off what they have made.

33
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,356
And what I will show you

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,596
is some of these cities

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,940
created by the players.

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,036
So the game is about self-expression,

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,316
creativity,

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,956
not just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,580
It is about showing what your cities look like.

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,396
So I have a couple of videos.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,236
These are from YouTube.

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,715
And these are some of the most interesting city designs I have seen.

43
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,236
So they are all different,

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,580
and I hope you like all of these.

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,196
This one is called The Netherlands.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,420
It's by Silvarret.

47
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,316
And when you start the game,

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,420
you have an empty piece of land.

49
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,876
This land, it can be based on the real world,

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,836
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,836
or you can, of course, download a city made by someone else

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,396
and play in that.

53
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,836
But what Silvarret has done here

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,436
is that what he wanted to make

55
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,196
was not a real city.

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,876
This is a fantasy city,

57
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,596
even though it looks real.

58
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,460
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands.

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,476
So he kind of investigated

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,516
what are the characteristics of cities in the Netherlands

61
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,116
and combined a couple of those,

62
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,836
and this is what he created.

63
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,516
So it is a city,

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,796
but it is not a real city,

65
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,076
but it could be.

66
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,780
It looks just like the Netherlands.

67
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,756
So the places are really densely populated.

68
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,756
So what you need is highways, trains,

69
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,036
anything connecting these small town centers together.

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,276
Lots of people, lots of moving,

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,420
so transportation is the key here.

72
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,036
But then let's go even more on the fantasy side.

73
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,700
Let's go into the future.

74
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,436
This is one of my personal favorites.

75
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,180
These city designs are what I love the most.

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,116
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

77
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,300
and the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,356
So the city is a big circle

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,220
with tinier circles inside.

80
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,476
And the thing is that you put all of the services in the center,

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,916
and then people actually live on the outer ring,

82
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,716
because there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution,

83
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,676
so that is where you want to live.

84
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,636
But the services are still really close by.

85
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,315
They are in the center.

86
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,500
And this is the soul of the game.

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,196
The player has to understand

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,796
what are the wishes, what are the needs

89
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
of the tiny people living in the cities.

90
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,316
So you need to know where you should put the things.

91
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,876
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,636
It needs to be accessible.

93
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,540
Citizens need to reach the hospital.

94
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,996
And this is one way to do it.

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,860
So maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.

96
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,900
And then even more into the future.

97
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,060
Astergea by Yuttho.

98
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,436
So Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.

99
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,116
What he did here was actually a 12-point series

100
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,300
of creating this city.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,356
So what he does is he plays the game,

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,636
he records it

103
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,300
and he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.

104
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,116
And as a part of this series,

105
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,396
he actually did an interview with an actual urban planner

106
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,220
called Jeff Speck.

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,076
And Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.

108
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,476
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk,

109
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,436
which is kind of beneficial,

110
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,196
you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.

111
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,020
It should be a good way to reach places.

112
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,196
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept,

113
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,236
he had Speck explain it, too,

114
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,220
and then he applied it to the city that he was building.

115
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,916
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future:

116
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,196
lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas,

117
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,820
connecting high-rise buildings.

118
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,196
Maybe this is what the future might look like.

119
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,676
And the game system works really well for this.

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,516
We are seeing some real-world uses to this game.

121
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,236
So we know that some urban planners are using it as a sketching tool,

122
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,556
so while the simulation is not completely realistic,

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,516
it is realistic enough that if something works in the game,

124
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,436
it is highly likely that it will also work in the real world,

125
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,556
so that you can actually try out things,

126
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,556
see if this intersection might fit this kind of a situation.

127
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,116
If we build a new road, would it help?

128
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,100
And this is what you can do with this game.

129
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,996
There was one really interesting contest held

130
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,700
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,476
So what they did was that they had a new area

132
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,900
that they wanted to develop in the city.

133
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,316
They made a map with the existing city,

134
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,516
they left empty the area that they would want to develop

135
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,876
and shared this map.

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,916
So anyone could download the map,

137
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,556
play the game, build the area

138
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,300
and submit their creations to the city council.

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,716
So they have not yet built anything,

140
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,516
but it might just be that they use one of these plans

141
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,876
made with the game

142
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,940
to actually build the real city.

143
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,596
And these videos that I have shown you,

144
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,220
these are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.

145
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,676
We know that cities are growing.

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,156
They're getting bigger as we go,

147
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,396
and the percentage of population living in cities is projected to rise.

148
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,316
So we need the solutions

149
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,036
and these people, playing the game,

150
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,716
they are trying out different kinds of solutions.

151
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,420
They might have something that is really important.

152
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:21,260
So what we are seeing here is dream cities that might be real one day.

153
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,796
So it might be

154
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,660
that this is not just a game.

155
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,476
It might be a way

156
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,660
to decide our own fate.

157
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,956
Thank you.

158
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,660
(Applause)
